# `Iuliia`

> Transliterate Cyrillic → Latin in every possible way

Transliteration means representing Cyrillic data (mainly names and geographic locations) with Latin letters. It is used for international passports, visas, green cards, driving licenses, mail and goods delivery etc.

`Iuliia` makes transliteration easy as calling `iuliia.translate()` in your favorite programming language.

Why use `Iuliia`:

-   20 transliteration schemas (rule sets), including all main international and Russian standards.
-   Correctly implements not only the base mapping, but all the special rules for letter combinations and word endings (AFAIK, Iuliia is the only library which does so).
-   Simple API and zero third-party dependencies.

Supported languages:

-   [JavaScript](https://github.com/nalgeon/iuliia-js)
-   [Python](https://github.com/nalgeon/iuliia-py)
